We biologically classified all the creatures in the region we plant trees according to the taxon kingdom shown on the right. Double click each taxon will isolate the species to help better visualize the location of each taxon kingdom. The taxon class shown on the left are more detailed sub-species of the creatures and can be isolated or vanished by clicking interaction. The trees our program planted improve the ecological environment there and serve the survival of these wild plants.The place where the tree is planted is a place with a good ecological environment (biodiversity). The trees and plants you donated provide a good ecological environment and provide habitat and food for animals.

$10 makes big differences, trees you invest in can create huge value in benefiting the local ecological environment. Trees'roots can make soil structure healthier which improve the living condition for neighboring plants, they are able to share bacteria, nutrients, and resources through underground chemical networks. You can manually zoom in or out the map to see biodiversity we observed in Fianarantsoa province, Distribution of biodiversity observations is similar to the distribution of trees owned by our donors, concentrated in the square area, it shows the trees our program planted improve the ecological environment there and serve the survival of these wildlife.
